Source code for paper MequiPreSite: enhancing protein-protein interaction site prediction via multi-view learning and variants of E(3)-equivariant graph neural network

The base data for ppis in [AttPreSite](https://github.com/tlaymedown/AttPreSite-public)

The data for protein-ligand in [GraphBind](http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/GraphBind/sourcecode.html)

We provide the model weights and save the results of the model run. You can get the results directly by running AWF.py, or you can find them in Model/Case_Study/MequiPreSIte.txt
